# Task-6
Create a Strong Password and Evaluate Its Strength
### 1. Create Passwords of Varying Complexity

1. password123
2. 123456
3. P@ssw0rd!
4. MyComputer$Rex2025

### 2. Test each password on password strength checker.

![1 password](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d7b181dc-2fe2-43f1-95e7-dd52aebca46e)


![2 password](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/98b1a9a2-c99b-4197-8bfa-e2e549a64ccd)


![3 password](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eb779cb6-5768-4093-b33a-10d91a696108)


![4 password](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c594adc-1bcf-4290-ac57-12c43e11d8d3)


| Password         | Complexity Level | Tool Feedback                        | Score  |
|------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------|--------|
| password123      | Low              | Too common, lacks symbols            |  49%   |
| 123456           | Very Low         | Extremely weak and predictable       |  31%   |
| P@ssw0rd!        | Medium           | Better, but still somewhat guessable |  82%   |
| MyComputer$Rex2025    | High        | Strong with good character variety   |  100%  |

### 3. Best practices for creating strong passwords.
1.  Use at least 12 characters.
2.  Combine uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.
3.  Avoid using dictionary words or common phrases.
4.  Use passphrases with a twist (eg.MyComputer$Rex2025).
5.  Do not reuse passwords.

### 4.  Common password attacks
#### 1. Brute Force
    Tries all combinations until it cracks the password. Longer and more complex passwords resist this.
    
#### 2. Dictionary Attack
    Uses a list of common words and phrases. Avoid using simple or common words.

#### 3. Phishing
    Tricking users to give up passwords. Always verify websites and emails.

### 5. Summary
  Improve your digital safety.
  <br>
  Common or reused passwords are highly vulnerable.
    <br>
  Randomness prevents guesswork and dictionary attacks.
